My execution of the code from https://github.com/revantteotia/clip-training

The model was trained on MS-COCO and  zero-shot tested on CIFAR100 and ImageNet.

* **Note:** The model performance is not yet good and suffers from overfitting on the training data. Since MS-COCO is small and not diverse enough, training on larger datasets can solve the issue.

* TODO:
  Train on larger and more diverse dataset
